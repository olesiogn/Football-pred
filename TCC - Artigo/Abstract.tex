\textbf{Abstract: }
Soccer is a sport played by two teams, whose goal is to transpose a ball between extremities - called goalposts - basically utilizing foot strokes. The winner of the match will be the team that can reach the goal more often in the game. The interest of so many people in the world for soccer generates not only viewers, but also many financial transactions around this sport. Computer systems that work on predicting results and helping to minimize risks and maximize profits become an important day-to-day work tool for soccer. The objective of this project is to test and compare the performance of some classifiers in predicting soccer matches results for Premier League, Serie A and Brasileir√£o Serie A. The classifiers used were logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, knn, svm and mlp. Training and testing and cross-validation methods were used for data division. The result is the accuracy of each classifier.\\
